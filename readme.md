## Tapir TTT2 Class

Includes a TTT2 Class that can spawn a friendly Tapir that fights for you.
Player's damaged by the Tapir will suffer the "Drowsy" status effect which will obscure their screen and play Touhou music on their end.
The concept is inspired by [Doremy Sweet](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Doremy_Sweet).

If you're not using the class but want to spawn a tapir in your own code then you can use the global `function SpawnTapir(owner: Player)`.
